# Prasunet_Code_TaskNo.1
The Caesar Cipher Program is a command-line tool designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This program provides a simple and interactive way to perform encryption and decryption operations.

Features:

Menu-Driven Interface: The program presents a menu-driven interface, allowing users to choose from three options: Encrypt, Decrypt, and Quit.
Encryption and Decryption: The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple and widely used encryption technique.
User Input: Users can input the text they want to encrypt or decrypt, as well as specify a shift value, which determines the number of positions each letter in the input text will be shifted.
Output: The encrypted or decrypted text is displayed on the console, allowing users to easily view the result.
Benefits:

Easy to Use: The program is designed to be easy to use, even for those without extensive knowledge of cryptography.
Interactive: The program provides an interactive way to learn about cryptography and encryption techniques.
Simple: The program's simplicity makes it an ideal tool for educational purposes or for those who want to quickly encrypt or decrypt text.
How to Use:

Run the Program: Run the program by executing the Python script.
Choose an Option: Choose an option from the menu: Encrypt, Decrypt, or Quit.
Input Text and Shift Value: Input the text you want to encrypt or decrypt, as well as a shift value.
View the Result: The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed on the console.

System Requirements:

Operating System: The program can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
Python: The program requires Python to be installed on the system.
